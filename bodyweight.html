            <li>
              <strong>Pull-up Bar:</strong> Essential for upper-body pulling exercises like pull-ups, chin-ups, and muscle-ups. It builds upper-body strength and allows for progressions leading to advanced movements like muscle-ups.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Dip Bars or Parallel Bars:</strong> Crucial for developing pushing strength in the chest, shoulders, and triceps. Dips can be advanced with the addition of weight or ring variations.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Resistance Bands:</strong> Perfect for assisting with difficult movements like pull-ups and dips or providing resistance during mobility work to help improve flexibility and strength.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Ab Wheel:</strong> (Optional) A powerful tool for building core strength and stability, helping improve body control during various calisthenics movements.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Rings:</strong> For advanced skill work and stabilization, rings engage more muscle groups than bars due to their instability, allowing for advanced exercises like ring dips, muscle-ups, and front lever work.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Weighted Vest:</strong> (Optional) Adds resistance to bodyweight exercises to increase intensity and stimulate muscle growth.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Yoga Mat or Padded Surface:</strong> Important for floor work, ensuring comfort and safety during exercises like push-ups, planks, and core exercises.
